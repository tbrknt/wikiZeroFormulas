# wikiZeroFormulas
OBSOLETE: Since Wiki-zero fixed that dysfunctionality, this extension is useless anymore. For other Wiki-Zero features, you can check my another extension at the following links:

Google Chrome: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/hamponpdlhceghibcaciddeoiidpmbaj/

Mozilla Firefox: https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/venividiwiki/

Its Github repo: https://github.com/tbrknt/veniVidiWiki/


A browser extension which enables displaying formulas on Wikipedia pages when visiting them with Wiki-Zero mirror. It only injects a script to the Wiki-Zero pages. It is an extension for Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox.

You can install the extension here for Google Chrome:
https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/wikizero-formulas/flkgiklgicdilllnllodgaedidkafiaa

You can install the extension here for Mozilla Firefox:
https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/wikizero-formulas/


Thanks for [Goksu](https://github.com/mgoksu), who has motivated me to implement this extension.
